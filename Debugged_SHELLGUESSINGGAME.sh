##Notes: 1.  'else' in the if conditional shouldn't have a semi colon at the end ( ; )
##  2.S
##  3.  when using the read -p command, you have to include the variable at the end of the description
##  4.  Its good practice to always write your variables in lowercase as uppercase variables are usually
##      interpreted as shell builtin variables
##  5.  You have to close your if loop with fi
